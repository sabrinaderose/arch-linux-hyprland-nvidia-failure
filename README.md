# Arch Linux VM Lab

This project documents the complete process of building, configuring, breaking, and recovering a custom Arch Linux virtual machine from scratch.

## Purpose
To build a foundational understanding of Linux internals by manually installing and maintaining Arch Linux on a virtual machine. This project simulates real-world sysadmin environments and documents challenges, fixes, and configurations.

## Goals
- Learn manual installation of Arch Linux (no `archinstall` script)
- Practice partitioning, bootloader setup, networking, and system configuration
- Document milestone progress with logs and screenshots
- Simulate break/fix scenarios for troubleshooting practice

## Tools
- VirtualBox (hosted on Pop!_OS)
- Arch Linux ISO (latest release)
- Shell scripting / `bash`
- `pacman`, `systemd`, `grub`, etc.

## Milestones
| # | Milestone | Status |
|--|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Partition disk + mount structure | [] |
| 2 | `pacstrap` base system + chroot | [] |
| 3 | Configure users, timezone, locale | [] |
| 4 | Install bootloader (GRUB) | [] |
| 5 | Setup networking + ping test | [] |
| 6 | Break system (intentional) + recover | [] |
